**THIS SHOULD NOT BE DEPLOYED TO A LIVE PRODUCTION SERVER: it is some kind of a DEMO project, that will be used as
support for a Workshop.**

This project is used as support for a workshop during which participants will setup a website that evaluates PHP code on
 several versions of PHP -- pretty much like [3v4l.org](https://3v4l.org/) or [eval.in](https://eval.in/).

The workshop is made of several parts, each about half-an-hour long, which will start from (almost) scratch and go as 
far as we can, depending on the total workshop's duration.

Before coming to the workshop, you should read `INSTALL-atelier-2016-04-30-lyon.md` and follow the instructions it
contains: it will allow us to get started faster, skipping some not-that-interesting steps.
