This project is used as support for a workshop during which participants will setup a website that evaluates PHP code on several versions of PHP -- pretty much like [3v4l.org](https://3v4l.org/) or [eval.in](https://eval.in/).

The workshop is made of several parts, each about half-an-hour long, which will start from (almost) scratch and go as far as we can, depending on the total workshop's duration.
